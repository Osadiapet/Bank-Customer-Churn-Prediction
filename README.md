# Customer Churn in the Telecom Industry
This is a predictive model to predict Customer Churn in the Telecommunication industry with machine learning techniques 
Customer attrition (a.k.a customer churn) is one of the biggest expenditures of any organization. If we could figure out why a customer leaves and when they leave with reasonable accuracy, it would immensely help the organization to strategize their retention initiatives manifold.

As perceive myself as a data scientist in the telecommunication industry, to help the organization in dealing with customer attrition by building a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a customer leaving the company. This will in turn help the company minimize the rate at which customers leave and increase their customer retention rate. This analysis is done based on historical data of customers.

I will be using supervised machine learning algorithms to build thsi model. This dataset was extracted from IBM IBM Cognos Analytics 11.1.3+ base samples dataset

Context
